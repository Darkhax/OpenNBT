#Contributing to OpenNBT

If you would like to create a Pull Request for OpenNBT, please read the following guidelines. 

1. Every new class, field and method should include documentation in the form of JavaDocs. If a method overrides an existing method, no documentation is needed.
2. Code should follow the style of existing code. Things like same line braces, and spaces over tabs. A formatter for Eclipse can be found [here](https://github.com/darkhax/OpenNBT/blob/master/Epoxide-Java-Format.xml).
3. Make sure to test your code before creating a pull request. Additional test cases are also welcomed.
